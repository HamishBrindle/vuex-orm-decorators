# vuex-orm-decorators
Decorator Syntax for Vuex ORM for better type safety.

Simple Typescript Decorators to simplify vuex-orm integration in typescript projects.

Using the decorators allows better type safety in your projects, by allowing you to create conventional Typescript properties, and anotate them as fields.  Removes the 'magic string' aspect of vuex-orm.

### Typescript
1. Set ```ExperimentalDecorators``` to true.
2. Set ```importHelpers: true```in ```tsconfig.json```.
3. Set ```emitHelpers: true``` in ```tsconfig.json``` (only required in typescript 2)

### Installation

```
npm isntall -D vuex-orm-decorators
```
